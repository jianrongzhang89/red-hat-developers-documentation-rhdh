= Configurations for Operator-backed RHDH

[NOTE]
====
Updates to the Backstage Custom Resource (CR) are automatically handled by the Operator. But updates to resources, for example ConfigMaps or Secrets, referenced in the CR are not handled automatically unless the CR itself is updated. In this case, you will need to manually delete the Backstage Deployment, so that the Operator can recreate it with the updated resources.
